# Button same and different actions (example) using js modules
**Example details:** 3 buttons that all increment count by one, and display different text depending on which one is clicked. One eventLister is used to operate all 3 buttons to achieve this. The code is also separated into modules for easy reading and acess. Run in browser to see how it works.
